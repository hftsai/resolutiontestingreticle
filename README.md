# reolustiontestingreticle
A resolution testing reticle for 5" chrome mask designed by Hsieh-Fu Tsai


Aim: To develop a 5 inch chrome mask with high resolution patterns to test the resolution of 1:1 exposure system as well as testing the exposure condition (power and time) for optimum results.

We will take advantage of a Suss microtech 6 section exposure accessories and design the resolution testing mask on top of it.

In each section, we have designed the same design containing the following patterns in both positive and negative form.

The file is prepared in AutoCAD 2016 and converted to DXF and to GDSII by KLayout.
Patterns:

1. 5mm micrometer with 50micron div (lineweight 5 micron and 10micron)

2. 1mm micrometer with 10micron div (lineweight 3 micron)

3. Siemens section star (72 section, 5 degree per section)

4. Ronchi Ruling of 10 lp/mm, 20lp/mm, 50lp/mm, 100lp/mm, and 200lp/mm

5. Grid of 50lp/mm, 100lp/mm, 150lp/mm, 200lp/mm

6. pin hole resolution dots of diameter of 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 20, 25, 50. spacing of 75, 50, 40, 30, 25, 20, 10, 7.5 micron

7. a USAF 1951 target from group 1 to group 8

8. a group of different line weight, 1, 2,3, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 37.5, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200 micron

9. 50micron line weight with different spacing from 1, 3, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250 micron.

In the original file you can find more groups of USAF 1951. the USAF1951 target is made according to the spec documented on wikipedia.

The file size restriction of github prevented me to upload the full files except the final GDSII file.
